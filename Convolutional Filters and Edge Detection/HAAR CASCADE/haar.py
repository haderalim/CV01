Face detection using OpenCV
One older (from around 2001), but still popular scheme for face detection is a Haar cascade classifier; 
these classifiers in the OpenCV library and use feature-based classification cascades that learn to isolate 
and detect faces in an image. You can read the original paper proposing this approach here.
'''
# load in color image for face detection
image = cv2.imread('images/multi_faces.jpg')

# convert to RBG
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.imshow(image)

'''
To use a face detector, we'll first convert the image from color to grayscale. For face detection this 
is perfectly fine to do as there is plenty non-color specific structure in the human face for our detector to learn on.
'''
# convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  

plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.imshow(gray, cmap='gray')

'''
Next we load in the fully trained architecture of the face detector, found in the file 
detector_architectures/ haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml,and use it on our image to find faces!
'''

'''
A note on parameters
How many faces are detected is determined by the function, detectMultiScale which aims to detect faces 
of varying sizes. The inputs to this function are: (image, scaleFactor, minNeighbors); you will often 
detect more faces with a smaller scaleFactor, and lower value for minNeighbors, but raising these 
values often produces better matches. Modify these values depending on your input image.
'''

# load in cascade classifier
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('detector_architectures/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# run the detector on the grayscale image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 4, 6)

'''
The output of the classifier is an array of detections; coordinates that define the dimensions of a
bounding box around each face. Note that this always outputs a bounding box that is square in dimension.
'''

# print out the detections found
print ('We found ' + str(len(faces)) + ' faces in this image')
print ("Their coordinates and lengths/widths are as follows")
print ('=============================')
print (faces)

#Let's plot the corresponding detection boxes on our original image to see how well we've done.  

img_with_detections = np.copy(image)   # make a copy of the original image to plot rectangle detections ontop of

# loop over our detections and draw their corresponding boxes on top of our original image
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # draw next detection as a red rectangle on top of the original image.  
    # Note: the fourth element (255,0,0) determines the color of the rectangle, 
    # and the final argument (here set to 5) determines the width of the drawn rectangle
    cv2.rectangle(img_with_detections,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),5)  

# display the result
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.imshow(img_with_detections)
