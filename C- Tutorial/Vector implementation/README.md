#1D vector

- To define vector in python, you need to declare list data type like this:
  image = [1, 2, 3]
  
- To define vector in c++, you need to declare vector data type like this:
  vector <int> image(3);
  image[0] = 1;
  image[1] = 2;
  image[2] = 3;

#2D vector or Matrix

- To define matrix in python, you need to declare list of list like this:
  image = [[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]]
           
- To define matrix in c++, you need to declare vector of vector like this:
  Like code in 2D_vector.cpp
